He leads me in paths of righteousness for his nameâ€™s sake.<br>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,<br>for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.<br>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;<br>You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.<br>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,<br>and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
