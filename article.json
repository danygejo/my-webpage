        "level_easy": "Psalm 51 is a prayer by King David. He made mistakes and felt sorry for them. He asked God to forgive him and make his heart clean again. Just like when we spill something and need to clean it up, David wanted God to clean his heart. He knew that God is full of love and always ready to forgive. This Psalm teaches us that no matter what we do, we can always talk to God, say sorry, and ask for a fresh start. If we make a mistake, we should admit it and ask for forgiveness. God loves us and wants us to live with a pure heart. Let’s always try to do the right thing and trust in God's mercy and love.",
        "level_medium": "Psalm 51 is one of the most well-known prayers of repentance in the Bible. King David wrote it after realizing he had done something very wrong. He asks God to have mercy on him and cleanse his heart. David understands that sin separates us from God, but he also knows that God is full of love and willing to forgive when we truly repent. In life, we all make mistakes, but Psalm 51 teaches us that admitting our faults and asking God for forgiveness is important. When we do this sincerely, God washes away our sins and helps us start fresh. This Psalm reminds us to always come to God with a humble heart, knowing that His love and grace are greater than any mistake we could ever make. By seeking God's forgiveness, we allow Him to transform us into better people who live according to His will.",
        "level_hard": "Psalm 51 is a deeply personal and emotional prayer written by King David after the prophet Nathan confronted him about his sins. It is one of the greatest examples of repentance in the Bible, showing us the importance of acknowledging our sins before God. David pleads for God's mercy, not based on his own worth, but on God’s unfailing love. He asks to be washed clean, recognizing that only God can remove sin completely. David understands that his sin is not just against people, but ultimately against God Himself. He acknowledges that God desires truth and sincerity in the heart rather than mere outward religious actions. In verse 10, he prays, 'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.' This shows his desire for true inner transformation, not just forgiveness. Psalm 51 teaches us that repentance is more than saying sorry; it is about turning away from sin and seeking a changed heart. Through this Psalm, we learn that God's mercy is abundant, and when we sincerely repent, He restores us and draws us closer to Him. This passage encourages us to live a life of humility, recognizing that we need God’s grace every day."
